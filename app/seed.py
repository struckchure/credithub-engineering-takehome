"""Seed synthetic loans + a little payment history.

Run once before starting the app:  python -m app.seed

The seeded events are already reconciled (applied/rejected) — they're history,
so the feed isn't empty on first load. New payments arrive via the webhook (the
"Simulate incoming payment" button).
